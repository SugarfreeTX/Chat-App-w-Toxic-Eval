# React-Chat-App-w/Toxic-Evaluator

A chat application similar to Twitch.tv where messages will be sent to TensorFlow's Fairness/Toxic Evaluation model. (Here is the model: https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/toxicity)


I'm using Socket.io with React and Node.js to build the chatroom. It will have emotes and !commands similar to what Twitch calls NightBot.
